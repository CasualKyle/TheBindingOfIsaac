- Contains items the player can buy with coins
	- Bombs
	- Hearts
	- All kinds of other shizz...
- Items are generated per floor
- Contains a door on the ground that goes to next floor
- Door unlocks when all rooms on the floor have been finished
- Every enemy the player kills rewards with one or more coins
- Enemies will get harder the deeper the player goes
- Scenery will change after a certain number of floor are complete
- Messages
	- At the start of every floor a message pops up and says "Level 1"
	- When an item is picked up a messages pops up and says "You got: [picture of item] \n [distription of item]"

Maybies

Status Effects
- Projectiles will have a status effect assosiated with them that will be inflicted on enemies upon hit
- The shot system will handle when a projectile gets the status effect
- The projectile system will check if a projectile has a status effect upon hit and inflict it upon the enemy

Status effects:
 - Freeze - enemy cannot move or shoot
 - Poison/fire - enemy takes damage over time

 Freezing enemies:
- Give enemy a freeze component
- In movement system
	- check if enemy has a freeze component
	- if so just return, don't move the enemy
- In shot system
	- check if enemy has a freeze component
	- if so just return, don't shoot anything

Fire/posion
- Give enemy a fire/posion component
- I would have to implement a fire/poision system
	- check if enemy has a fire/posion component
	- damage enemy over time
